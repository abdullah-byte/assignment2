//Difference between Var, Let and Const
//Var
//Declarations are global outside the function meaning they are defined throughout the program but are local when declared within a function
//Let: Variables declared by let cannot be redeclared and must be declared before use
//Const: Const creates a variable that cannot be reassigned another value
